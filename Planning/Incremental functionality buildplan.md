Incremental functionality buildplan (talk abt this since I'm having to do this as I come up with new ideas that add. on to og plan):
- Choosing one of multiple restaurants
- Lazy loading with loading screen (just a modal with a barber pole) and text that says loading from site and after loaded foods appear 'gpt-ifying' for respective steps
- Federated google login working
- Little message/modal/t style redirect to federated clicking the save meal or preferences buttons also like a login or signup button with small text and the same message just ape yt
- Sign up where they can preset preferences and set locations (midnight scraped from dropdown for institute, college, or university)
- This is another table, location and specific restaurant to url
- Profile page where they can update preferences
- Ability to update/customize nutrition of gpt-d foods
-Also don't have add/remove on the display yet unless they click a "manually add/remove items" button
- This will force login if attempted by guests
- Will visually highlight the foods as yellow
- Also have a disclaimer of inaccuracy on apt nutrition modal and meals/sets of food items like reas containing apt-d foods
- Abilitv to save meals
- Meal table and users table required in db
- also a create meal button and a choose meal dropdown and a save meal button
- in both profile and main page the ability to make a meal your chosen meal
- Dropdown in profile page to choose day, allowing you to see cumulative nutrition of chosen meals across days
- Also to choose which bon appetit locations you are a part of (these are preloaded, up to three)
- Overhaul styling w bootstrap 5
- Hover over food units to help with unit understandings

- Maybe can be advertised as an extension that just shows the pie chart thing and a loading screen or whatever, and directs you to the site for further customization
